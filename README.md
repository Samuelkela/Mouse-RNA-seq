# Mouse-RNA-seq
Exploratory Analysis of single cell RNA seq data from mus musculus
About this Dataset
Tabula Muris (https://tabula-muris.ds.czbiohub.org/) is a compendium of single-cell transcriptome data from the model organism Mus musculus, containing nearly 100,000 cells from 20 organs and tissues. The data allow for direct and controlled comparison of gene expression in cell types shared between tissues, such as immune cells from distinct anatomical locations. They also allow for a comparison of two distinct technical approaches:

microfluidic droplet-based 3â€™-end counting: provides a survey of thousands of cells per organ at relatively low coverage
FACS-based full length transcript analysis: provides higher sensitivity and coverage.
The full dataset includes both high throughput but low-coverage 10X data and lower throughput but high-coverage Smartseq2 data.

This data use the Smartseq2 data from the mouse brain. This data consists of:

an expression matrix where each column corresponds to a gene (or transcript) and each row corresponds to a single cell
a table of metadata describing each cell
